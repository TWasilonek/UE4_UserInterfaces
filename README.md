# Unreal Engine 4 - UserInterfaces

This is a personal project in which I am exploring creating user interfaces with C++ in Unreal Engine.
 
Current content:
- Login panel - uses HTTP connection and a test web server written in Node.js
- Todo application - I did this purely for fun to exercise making CRUD operations in UE + dynamically creating / destroying UMG widgets.
